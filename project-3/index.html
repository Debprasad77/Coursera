        <p>Springtime in <a href="https://www.a2gov.org/">Ann Arbor</a> is a beautiful time. Even though it can be chilly at times, it is nice to walk my dog Bacon. This site includes some pictures I have taken on these walks.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes we walk around the neighborhood, other times we make it to the woods. Ann Arbor also has some beautiful lakes and rivers including the <a href="https://huronriverwatertrail.org/">Huron River Watertrail</a> and the <a href="https://www.a2gov.org/parks-and-recreation/parks-and-places/argo-park-canoe-livery/">Argo Park Cascades</a>.</p>
